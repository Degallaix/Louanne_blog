Neurological science is a large and complex subject. When I had to find articles, it was not difficult. The difficulty was the choice. 

In general, I do not read scientific magazines. I prefer reading other types of books. That allows me to take my mind off things. Thanks to the portfolio I have discovered that those magazines can be interesting too.

*What do I learn about brain diseases?*

I have learnt that the origins of brain diseases can be genetic, protein production, pollution. You can also catch a brain disease if you do no sport. I have also discovered some new treatments like using the immune system or ultrasound.

In my opinion the most impressive article was “New tactic to stop the growth of a deadly brain cancer”. It gives hope for future not invasive treatments even for other cancers. It demonstrates that the body has more capacities than we thought. Each discovery brings for a change for the better in people’s health.
