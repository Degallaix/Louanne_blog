- Oct. 11th: This week, I watched three Jimmy Fallon's videos. The first one is an interview of Gad Elmaleh. I didn't know he was making shows in America. In the second one Jimmy Fallon makes jokes about political news, covid,... In the last one, he jokes about persons who cough in restaurant, parents who have to help their children with their virtual homework,...
It was the first time I watched such programs. That makes me laugh.
